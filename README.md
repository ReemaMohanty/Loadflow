This is an example repository to create a load flow simulation using panda power.
The coding is done in python environment.

It has answers to:

a.	Create the electricity distribution network model defined in the sheet1.

b.	Run two load flow simulations, one for each topology configuration (switch open and switch closed).

c.	Export the bus voltages, line currents, and transformer powers in a tabular format.

Additional task performed are:

a. Apply a load profile to one or more of the loads.

b. Add a renewable generator to one of the low voltage buses 

c. Assign x and y coordinates to the network elements and present the results in singe line diagram format or geospatial format.
